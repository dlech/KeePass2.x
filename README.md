This is a hand-maintained mirror of the offical KeePass2.x source code.

## Branches

The default branch is `VS2015`. You should be able to clone this branch and build it
in Visual Studio 2015 with no changes.

The `offical` branch contains exactly the official source code that is distributed on
SourceForge. Some manual changes are required to get this branch to build.
