<td><h1>Database Settings</h1>
<p>Describes the various database options.</p></td>
</tr></table>

<p>On the database settings dialog, you can configure various database-related
settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#general">General</a></li>
<li><a href="#security">Security Options</a></li>

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" alt="" />
General</h2>

<p>On this tab page you can specify general things like the name of the database and
a description. Additionally, you can set various defaults like a default user
name for new entries (created in this database).</p>

<br />

<a name="security"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" alt="" />
Security Options</h2>

<p>On this tab page you can specify various settings related to encryption.
Only change these settings if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p><b>Encryption Algorithm:</b><br />
You can choose the algorithm that is used to encrypt the database.
All encryption algorithms offered by KeePass are well-known, secure algorithms,
see <a href="../base/security.html#secencrypt">Database Encryption</a>.</p>

<p><b>Key Transformation:</b><br />
See <a href="../base/security.html#secdictprotect">Protection against
Dictionary Attacks</a>.</p>

<p>KeePass has a button on this tab page to compute the number of key transformations
that your computer can do in 1 second. If you for instance only want to wait 0.5 seconds,
half the number resulted from the benchmark.</p>

<br />

<!-- <a name="protection"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" alt="" />
Protection Options</h2>

<p>On this tab page you can configure run-time memory protection settings for this
database. Fields can be stored encrypted in process memory. This ensures that no
other application can read your data by dumping the memory of KeePass.</p>

<p>It is recommended to turn on memory protection for password fields and leave it
disabled for all others. Process memory protection slows down all operations
a bit, you should therefore carefully decide which fields are really worth
to be protected this way.</p>

<p>Memory protection is useless if you display the fields in the main window
(because if they are displayed in this window, they are automatically stored
as plain-text in memory as Windows needs to be able to read it), therefore
KeePass offers you to turn on visual hiding in the main window for the selected
protected fields. It is highly recommended to check this option before closing
the dialog.</p>

<br /> -->

<a name="compression"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_tar.png" alt="" />
Compression Options</h2>

<p>KeePass databases can be compressed before being encrypted. Compression
reduces the size of the database, but also slows down the database
saving/loading process a bit.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use the <i>GZip</i> compression option. This algorithm
is very fast (you won't notice any difference to saving the database without
compression) and its compression rate is acceptable.</p>

<p>It is <i>not</i> recommended to save databases without compression.</p>

<p>On modern PCs, saving files with compression can actually be faster than
saving without compression, because the compression process is performed by
the CPU (which is very fast) and fewer data has to be transferred from/to
the storage device. Especially when the device is slow (like saving to USB
stick), compression can reduce the saving/loading time significantly.</p>

<br />

<a name="templates"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" alt="" />
Templates</h2>

<p>Templates are a great way to predefine often used user names or
additional fields, or combinations of each.</p>

<ul>
<li>A template is a normal KeePass entry with all required data already
entered.</li>
<li>Templates must be kept in a single group.</li>
<li>Do not put real data entries in the template group.</li>
</ul>

<p>First create a normal group in the main window and then set it as the
templates group in <i>'File'</i> &rarr;
<i>'Database Settings'</i> &rarr; tab <i>'Advanced'</i>.</p>

<p>In order to create a new entry based on a template,
click the drop-down arrow of the <i>'Add Entry'</i> toolbar button
and choose the template to be used.</p>
