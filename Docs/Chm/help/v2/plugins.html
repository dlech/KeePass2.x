Introduction</h2>

<p>KeePass features a plugin framework. Plugins can provide additional
functionality, like support of more file formats for import/export,
network functionalities, backup features, etc.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_message.png" alt="" />
Online Resources</h2>

<p>Plugins can be found on the
<a href="https://keepass.info/plugins.html" target="_blank">Plugins</a> page.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_package_system.png" alt="" />
Plugin Installation and Uninstallation</h2>

<p>If there are no explicit instructions how to install the plugin,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the plugin from the page above and unpack the ZIP file to a
new folder.</li>
<li>In KeePass, click 'Tools' &rarr; 'Plugins' &rarr; button
'Open Folder'; KeePass now opens a folder called 'Plugins'.
Move the new folder (containing the plugin files) into the 'Plugins' folder.</li>
<li>Restart KeePass in order to load the new plugin.</li>
</ol>

<!-- <p>In short, to install a plugin you simply need to unpack it
somewhere into the 'Plugins' folder.</p> -->

<p>To uninstall a plugin, delete the plugin files.</p>

<p><strong>Linux:</strong><br />
On some Linux systems, the <code>mono-complete</code> package may be
required for plugins to work properly.</p>

<p><strong>Portability:</strong><br />
PLGX plugins are compiled by KeePass and the generated files are stored
in a <a href="#cache">plugin cache</a>, which by default is located in the
user's application data directory (so, running a PLGX plugin by default
creates files outside the KeePass application directory).
These plugin cache files do not need to be copied to other systems though,
because they are generated on each system and do not contain any user data.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" alt="" />
Security</h2>

<p>Plugins must be stored in the 'Plugins' folder of the KeePass application
directory. An attacker who can copy a malicious plugin into this folder
could typically also replace the 'KeePass.exe' file by malware.
As protection against such attacks, an appropriate file system
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists"
target="_blank">access control list</a> (ACL) should be used
(for the whole KeePass application directory, including the 'Plugins' folder);
administrator privileges should be required for write access.</p>

<ul>
<li>The KeePass installer and the MSI package install KeePass into the
Program Files directory by default. This directory typically has an
appropriate ACL, and the KeePass application directory inherits this ACL.
So, you do not need to specify an ACL manually.</li>

<li>If you installed KeePass to a different directory or if you use the
portable package, it is recommended that you specify an appropriate ACL
manually.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DLL vs. PLGX:</strong><br />
KeePass supports two plugin file formats: DLL and
<a href="https://keepass.info/help/v2_dev/plg_index.html#plgx" target="_blank">PLGX</a>.
A DLL plugin is loaded directly, whereas KeePass needs to compile a PLGX
plugin to a DLL plugin first, which is then stored in a
<a href="#cache">plugin cache</a> (see the section below).</p>

<p>By default, the user has write access in the PLGX plugin cache directory
(without administrator privileges).
This is not a security vulnerability. Let us assume that an attacker has write
access in the plugin cache directory and the goal is code execution.
The plugin cache folder is typically located in the user's profile directory
and has the same ACL, i.e. the attacker has write access in the user's profile
directory.
With this, there are many ways to execute malware (a few examples can be found
here: '<a href="https://keepass.info/help/kb/sec_issues.html#cfgw" target="_blank">Write
Access to Configuration File</a>').
Stand-alone malware can also be specialized on attacking KeePass (see
'<a href="../base/security.html#secspecattacks">Specialized Spyware</a>');
it does not need to be a plugin for this.
Furthermore, an anti-virus software scans all files containing executable code
(EXE, DLL, ...); a malware is either detected or not, independent of where in
the user's profile directory it is stored.</p>

<p>If you worry about this anyway, consider to adjust the ACL of the PLGX
plugin cache directory to require administrator privileges for write access.
Note though that this may result in some plugins not working properly anymore
(those that assume to have write access in the plugin cache directory),
and the KeePass option 'Delete old files from cache automatically' also may
not work anymore.</p>

<p>In the case of a dual package (DLL and PLGX in the same folder), KeePass
loads the DLL file (and ignores the PLGX file), if possible.</p>

Plugin Cache</h2>

<p>PLGX plugins (not DLL plugins) are compiled and stored in a plugin cache directory
on the user's system. This cache improves the startup performance of KeePass.
Old files are normally deleted from the cache automatically
(this can be disabled in the plugins dialog).
The cache does not contain any user data.</p>

<p>By default, the plugin cache is located in the user's local application data
directory (<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\KeePass\PluginCache</code>).
However, this can be overridden using the
<code>Application/PluginCachePath</code> setting in the
<a href="https://keepass.info/help/kb/config_enf.html" target="_blank">enforced
configuration file</a>
(this setting supports placeholders and environment variables).
So, if you are for example using KeePass on a portable device and do not want
the cache to be on the system, you could set the path to <code>{APPDIR}\PluginCache</code>.</p>

<p><img src="../images/b16x16_warning.png" class="textimg" alt="Warning" />
Do not relocate the plugin cache into the 'Plugins' folder of the
KeePass application directory, because this can result in a severe
performance degradation.</p>
