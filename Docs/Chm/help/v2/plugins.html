<p>KeePass features a plugin framework. Plugins can provide additional
functionality, like support of more file formats for import/export,
network functionalities, backup features, etc.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_message.png" class="singleimg" alt="Info" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Online
Resources</h2>

<p>You can download the latest KeePass plugins (and their source code) from
<a href="http://keepass.info/plugins.html"
target="_blank">http://keepass.info/plugins.html</a>.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle">

Installation and Uninstallation</h2>

<p>If the plugin doesn't provide explicit instructions how to install it,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the plugin from the page above and unpack the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.</li>
<li>Copy the unpacked plugin files into the KeePass directory (where the
<i>KeePass.exe</i> is) or a subdirectory of it.</li>
<li>Restart KeePass in order to load the new plugin.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, to &quot;install&quot; a plugin you simply need to copy it somewhere
into the KeePass directory.</p>

<p>To &quot;uninstall&quot; a plugin, delete the plugin files.</p>

<br />

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" class="singleimg" alt="Locked" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Security</h2>

<p><i>What about the security of plugins? Can't malicious
spyware plugins
'inject' themselves into KeePass?</i></p>

<p>If plugins can register themselves
(i.e. have write access to the KeePass directory), they could also just
replace the whole <i>KeePass.exe</i>. It's rather a problem of file access
rights, not the plugin system.</p>

<p>If you worry about this, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install KeePass as administrator.</li>
<li>Write-protect the KeePass directory. Nobody must have write access.</li>
<li>Log on as normal user (with no administrator privileges).</li>
</ol>

<p>This will solve the problem above. Since the KeePass directory is write-protected,
no other program can copy files into it. KeePass requires the plugins to
be in the application directory. Therefore, plugins cannot inject themselves anymore.</p>

<br />

Cache</h2>

<p>PLGX plugins are compiled and stored in a plugin cache directory on the
user's system. This cache highly improves the startup performance of KeePass.
Old files are normally deleted from the cache
automatically (this can be disabled in the plugins dialog).</p>

<p>By default, the plugin cache is located in the user's application data
directory. However, this can be overridden using the
<code>Application/PluginCachePath</code> setting in the configuration file
(this setting supports placeholders and environment variables).
So, if you're for example using KeePass on a portable device and don't want
the cache to be on the system, you could set the path to <code>{APPDIR}\PluginCache</code>.</p>
