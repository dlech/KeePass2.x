General information</h2>

<p>When downloading KeePass, you have the choice between 3 different packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>KeePass-<i>2.xx</i>-Setup.exe:</b> An installer program for Windows.</li>
<li><b>KeePass-<i>2.xx</i>.zip:</b> A KeePass ZIP package (portable version).</li>
<li><b>KeePass-<i>2.xx</i>-Source.zip:</b> The source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The installer and the portable version are described in detail below.</p>

<p>The source code package contains everything you need to compile KeePass.
It includes the C#/C++ source code and header files, resource files,
sources for building the installer, etc.</p>

<!-- <p>Both installed and portable KeePass versions require a .NET framework,
see the downloads page for details.</p> -->

<p><b>Updating KeePass:</b><br />
When a new KeePass version has been released, you can update your existing KeePass
installation, without losing any configuration settings. The steps are
depending on which package you are using (installer or portable), see below.</p>

<p>Translations should also be updated when you install a new KeePass version.
You can find the latest translation files here:
<a href="https://keepass.info/translations.html" target="_blank">KeePass Translations</a>.</p>

<br />
<a name="installer"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_package_system.png" alt="" />
Installer program (KeePass-2.xx-Setup.exe file)</h2>

<p>The KeePass development team provides an installer, which copies KeePass
to your hard disk, creates shortcuts in the start menu and associates
KDBX files with KeePass, if desired.</p>

<p>Additionally, KeePass is automatically configured to store its settings in
the application data directory of the current user.
This way multiple users can use one KeePass
installation without overwriting each other's settings (each user has his
own <a href="../base/configuration.html">configuration</a> file).
The setup program must run with administrative
rights, however KeePass runs fine without administrative rights once it
is installed.</p>

<p><b>Installation:</b><br />
To install KeePass, run the <code>KeePass-2.xx-Setup.exe</code> file
and follow the wizard.</p>

<p><b>Updating:</b><br />
Run the <code>KeePass-2.xx-Setup.exe</code> file.
You do <i>not</i> need to uninstall the old version first.
Your configuration options will not be lost.</p>

<p><b>Uninstallation:</b><br />
In order to uninstall KeePass, run the uninstallation program, which is
accessible by a shortcut in the start menu folder of KeePass, or in
the program section of the system control panel. If you also want
to remove your configuration settings, you need to delete the configuration
file in the application data directory of your user profile, see
<a href="../base/configuration.html">Configuration</a>.</p>

<p><b>Silent Installation:</b><br />
The KeePass installer <code>KeePass-2.xx-Setup.exe</code> supports command line
switches for silent installation, i.e. the program gets installed without
asking the user for target directory or association options. The default settings
of the installer are used.</p>

<p>The <code>/SILENT</code> command line switch performs a silent
installation and shows a status dialog during the setup process. No questions
will be asked though.</p>

<p>The <code>/VERYSILENT</code> command line switch performs a silent
installation and does <i>not</i> show a status dialog during the setup process.</p>

<p><b>Destination Path:</b><br />
The installer allows to choose the destination path to which KeePass is
installed.
However, when the installer detects an existing KeePass installation, it
assumes that the user wants to perform an upgrade and thus doesn't
display the destination path selection page; the old version will be overwritten
by the new version.
If you want to move an existing KeePass installation to a different path,
first uninstall the old version; the installer of the new version will then
display the destination path selection page again.</p>

<p><b>Options/Components:</b><br />
The installation options/components are explained in detail here:
<a href="https://keepass.info/help/kb/faq.html#instopt2x" target="_blank">What
do the 2.x installation options/components mean in detail?</a>.</p>

<br />

<a name="portable"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_usbpendrive_unmount.png" alt="" />
Portable version (KeePass-2.xx.zip file)</h2>

<p>The portable version can be carried around on portable devices (like USB
sticks) and runs on any computer directly from the device, without any
installation<!-- (provided that a .NET framework is installed) -->.
It doesn't store anything on your system (in contrast to
the setup package, see above). KeePass doesn't create any new
registry keys and it doesn't create any configuration files in your Windows
or application data directory of your user profile.</p>

<p>Make sure that KeePass has write access to
its application directory. Otherwise, if it doesn't have, it'll attempt
to store the configuration options (nothing security-relevant though) into the
application data directory of the currently logged on user.
For more about that, see this page:
<a href="../base/configuration.html">Configuration</a>.</p>

<p><b>Installation:</b><br />
KeePass does not need to be installed. Just download the ZIP package, unpack
it with your favorite ZIP program and KeePass is ready to be used. Copy it to
a location of your choice (for example onto your USB stick); no
additional configuration or installation is needed.</p>

<p><b>Updating:</b><br />
Download the latest portable package of KeePass, unpack it
and copy all new files over the old ones. Your configuration settings will not
be lost (the settings are stored in the <i>KeePass.config.xml</i> file,
which won't be overwritten, because KeePass ZIP packages don't
include a <i>KeePass.config.xml</i> file).</p>

<p><b>Uninstallation:</b><br />
Simply delete the KeePass folder.<!-- This will leave no trace of KeePass on
your system. --></p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_package_system.png" alt="" />
Running KeePass under Mono (Linux, MacOS, BSD, ...)</h2>

<p>In addition to Windows, KeePass 2.x runs under Mono,
i.e. Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.</p>

<p>Links to all supported packages can be found on the
<a href="https://keepass.info/download.html" target="_blank">Downloads</a> page.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Debian/Ubuntu Linux:</strong><br />

(from the FreeBSD ports tree or binary pkg repository; link on the downloads page).<br />
<br /></li>

<li><strong>Other Unix-like systems:</strong><br />
In order to run KeePass, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/"
target="_blank">Mono &#8805; 2.6</a> (older versions will not work and are
not supported). Depending on your platform, the packages to install are called
<code>mono-stable</code>, <code>MonoFramework</code>,
<code>mono-devel</code> or <code>mono-2.0-devel</code>; see
the <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono project page</a>,
if you are unsure which packages to install.</li>

<li>On some platforms, the Windows Forms implementation (System.Windows.Forms)
is offered as a separate package.
KeePass requires this package; so if you see one, install it, too.</li>

<li>On some platforms, the Runtime namespace (System.Runtime)
is offered as a separate package.
KeePass requires this package; so if you see one, install it, too.</li>

<li>If you want to use auto-type on Linux/MacOS/BSD/etc., you additionally
need the <code>xdotool</code> package.</li>

<li>Download the portable version of KeePass (ZIP package)
and unpack it to a location of your choice.</li>

<li>When being in the KeePass directory, run the command line
&quot;<code>mono KeePass.exe</code>&quot;. Alternatively, right-click onto
the <code>KeePass.exe</code> file, choose &quot;Open with Other Application&quot;
and type in <code>mono</code> as custom command.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the last step you might want to create a shortcut
or shell script file with this command line (use an absolute path to
<code>KeePass.exe</code>, if the shortcut / shell script file is in a
different location).</p>

<!-- <p><b>Clipboard:</b><br />
On some systems, Mono's clipboard routines don't work properly.
In this case, install the <code>xsel</code> and <code>xdotool</code> packages.
If these are installed, KeePass uses them for clipboard operations.</p> -->

<p><b>Global Auto-Type:</b><br />
In order to use <a href="../base/autotype.html#autoglobal">global auto-type</a>,
you need to create an appropriate system-wide hot key. This only needs to be done
manually once. KeePass performs global auto-type when it's invoked with
the <code>--auto-type</code> <a href="../base/cmdline.html">command line</a> option.</p>

<p>Some examples how to create a system-wide hot key for global auto-type,
for different operating systems:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>KDE.</b>
On Linux systems with KDE, the hot key can be created in <i>Computer</i>
&rarr; <i>System Settings</i> &rarr; <i>Shortcuts and Gestures</i>:
in this dialog, go <i>Edit</i> &rarr; <i>New</i> &rarr; <i>Global Shortcut</i> &rarr;
<i>Command/URL</i>, specify the shortcut on the <i>Trigger</i> tab
and enter<br />
<code>mono /<i>YourPathToKeePass</i>/KeePass.exe --auto-type</code><br />
into the <i>Command/URL</i> field on the <i>Action</i> tab.
</li>

<li><b>Ubuntu Linux &ge; 11.04 (Unity/GNOME).</b>
Open the dialog <i>Keyboard Shortcuts</i> in the system preferences,
click the <i>Add</i> button, enter <code>KeePass Auto-Type</code> as name
and<br />
<code>mono /<i>YourPathToKeePass</i>/KeePass.exe --auto-type</code><br />
as command, then click [Apply]. Click on <i>Disabled</i> of the newly
created item (such that the text <i>'New shortcut...'</i> appears),
press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>, and close the dialog.
</li>
 
<li><b>Ubuntu Linux &le; 10.10 (GNOME).</b>
<ol>
<li>Press <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></kbd>,
enter <code>gconf-editor</code> and click [OK].</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>apps</code> &rarr; <code>metacity</code> &rarr; <code>keybinding_commands</code>.</li>
<li>Double-click one of the <code>command_<i>i</i></code> items, enter<br />
<code>mono /<i>YourPathToKeePass</i>/KeePass.exe --auto-type</code><br />
and click [OK].</li>
<li>Click the <code>global_keybindings</code> node on the left.</li>
<li>Double-click the appropriate <code>run_command_<i>i</i></code> item
(for example, when you've used <code>command_5</code> in the previous steps,
double-click <code>run_command_5</code> now) and specify the hot key of your
choice. For example, to use <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd></kbd>
as hot key, you'd enter <code>&lt;Control&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;a</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Important: for global auto-type, the version of the <code>xdotool</code> package
must be 2.20100818.3004 or higher! If your distribution only offers an
older version, you can download and install the latest version of the
package manually, see the <a href="https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/"
target="_blank"><code>xdotool</code></a> website.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Type on Wayland:</strong><br />
If you want to use auto-type on a system with a Wayland compositor,
see the <a href="https://keepass.info/help/kb/autotype_wayland.html"
target="_blank">Auto-Type on Wayland</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>AES-KDF:</strong><br />
For fast <a href="../base/security.html#secdictprotect">key transformations</a>
using AES-KDF, make sure that the <code>libgcrypt</code> library is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Argon2:</strong><br />
For fast <a href="../base/security.html#secdictprotect">key transformations</a>
using Argon2, make sure that the <code>libargon2</code> library is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Plugins:</strong><br />
On some Linux systems, the <code>mono-complete</code> package
may be required for plugins to work properly.</p>

<p><strong>TLS 1.2:</strong><br />
For TLS 1.2 support, Mono 4.8.0 or higher (or .NET Framework 4.5 or higher)
is required.</p>

<p><strong>Fonts:</strong><br />
On some Linux systems, the <code>ttf-mscorefonts-installer</code> package
may be required.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_package_system.png" alt="" />
Running KeePass under Wine (Linux, MacOS, BSD, ...)</h2>

<p>Although you can run KeePass 2.x more or less natively on Unix-like systems
using Mono (see above), the user interface does not always look pretty.
Some users therefore prefer running KeePass 2.x under Wine.</p>

<p>In order to run KeePass 2.x under Wine, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that Wine is installed.
Typically the package to install is called <code>wine</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure that .NET Framework 4.5 or higher is installed in Wine, see
<a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=2586"
target="_blank">WineHQ AppDB: .NET Framework</a>.<br />
For installing .NET Framework 4.5, <code>winetricks</code> can be used, see
<a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=25478"
target="_blank">WineHQ AppDB: .NET Framework 4.5</a>.</li>
<li>Download the latest portable package of KeePass 2.x (ZIP file) and unpack it
into some directory of your choice.</li>
<li>Run <code>wine KeePass.exe</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Theme.</strong>
By default, Wine uses the classic Windows theme. If you prefer some other
theme, you can install it in 'Applications' &rarr; 'Wine' &rarr; 'Configure Wine' &rarr;
tab 'Desktop Integration'.
Links to themes can for instance be found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP_visual_styles"
target="_blank">Wikipedia: Windows XP visual styles</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Type.</strong>
Wine currently does not implement all Windows API functions required for
auto-type, i.e. auto-type does not work when running KeePass under Wine.</p>

<!-- <p><strong>MacOS.</strong>
In order to make a MacOS application bundle wrapper, you can use
<a href="http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Wineskin</a>.
In the wrapper settings, we recommend to go to 'Screen Options' and turn on
the option 'Use Mac Driver instead of X11'.</p> -->

Portable KeePass using Mono</h2>

<p><i>The approach below worked perfectly when this documentation was written.
However, as this type of Mono installation is nowhere mentioned on the Mono
website, it might stop working with a future Mono release.</i></p>

<p>Although almost all of today's PCs can run .NET applications (the .NET Framework
is already preinstalled on Windows &ge; Vista, and for all major Linux/MacOS
distributions Mono is available, which actually even is a dependency of the GNOME
&ge; 2.16 desktop), you still might want to run KeePass 2.x on a PC without
any .NET support, like an old Windows XP system where you don't have administrative
rights to install the .NET Framework.</p>

<p>For such a situation, you can create a portable version of KeePass using Mono,
which works on PCs without .NET. To do this, follow these steps (assuming a Windows PC):</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the latest portable ZIP package of KeePass 2.x
(file <code>KeePass-<i>2.xx</i>.zip</code>).
Unpack it to some location, e.g. a folder <code>E:\KeePass</code> on your USB stick.</li>
<li>Download the latest Mono installer. Run it to locally install Mono on your current
PC (e.g. on <code>C:</code>).
KeePass doesn't require GTK+, GNOME or XSP, so you can disable the options for these during
the installation.</li>
<li>After installing Mono, copy
the whole Mono application folder
(e.g. <code>C:\Program Files\Mono</code>)
to your USB stick, e.g. to <code>E:\Mono</code>.</li>
<li>In order to simplify starting KeePass, create a batch file on your USB stick,
e.g. <code>E:\RunKeePass.bat</code>. This batch file should run KeePass using
the <code>mono.exe</code> application on the USB stick. For example, with the paths above,
the content of the batch file would look like:
<pre>
START &quot;&quot; Mono\bin\mono.exe KeePass\KeePass.exe
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to run KeePass on a PC without .NET support, simply plug in
the USB stick and run the batch file.</p>

<p>The approach above should be seen as the very last
possibility to run KeePass 2.x. Installing .NET support (either the .NET
Framework or Mono) is highly recommended instead!</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_package_system.png" alt="" />
Migrating from KeePass 1.x to 2.x</h2>

<p>In order to migrate from KeePass 1.x to 2.x, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install KeePass 2.x.<br />
If you're using the installer, make sure that the component
'Native Support Library' is being installed
(by default this component is enabled).</li>
<li>Run KeePass 2.x and create a new KDBX database file (via 'File' &rarr;
'New').</li>
<li>Import your old KDB database file into your new KDBX database file
(via 'File' &rarr; 'Import', file format 'KeePass KDB (1.x)').</li>
</ol>

<p>If everything works fine, you can delete your old KeePass 1.x
installation. The old KDB database file also isn't required anymore,
but you may want to keep it as a backup.</p>
