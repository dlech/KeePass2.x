<img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction:
What is Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation?</h2>

<p>The <a href="../base/autotype.html">Auto-Type</a> feature of KeePass
is very powerful: it sends simulated keypresses to other applications.
This works with all Windows applications and
for the target applications it's not possible to distinguish between
real keypresses and the ones simulated by Auto-Type.

This at the same time is the main disadvantage of Auto-Type, because
keyloggers can eavesdrop the simulated keys.

That's where Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation (TCATO) comes into play.</p>

<p>TCATO makes standard keyloggers useless. It uses the
Windows clipboard to transfer parts of the auto-typed text into the
target application. Keyloggers can see the <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd></kbd>
presses, but do not log the actual contents pasted from the clipboard.</p>

<p>Clipboard spies don't work either, because only parts of the sensitive
information is transferred on this way.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's not perfectly secure (and unfortunately cannot be made
by theory). None of the currently available keyloggers or clipboard spies
can eavesdrop an obfuscated auto-type process, but it is theoretically possible
to write a dedicated spy application that specializes on logging obfuscated
auto-type.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;When can
Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation be used?</h2>

<p>TCATO cannot be used with all windows. The target window(s) must
support clipboard operations and navigation within edit controls using arrow keys.
Additionally, the target user interface must not contain automation features like
jumping focus when maximum length of a text box is reached (as seen in registration
number dialogs for example).</p>

<p>Rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Can be used in:</b>

<ul>
<li>Browsers.</li>
<li>Windows programs with standard text boxes.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Can not be used in:</b>

<ul>
<li>Console-based applications (interactive terminals, ...).</li>
<li>Games.</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Because it doesn't work with all windows, it's an opt-in feature for each
entry. You have to enable it explicitly on the <i>'Auto-Type'</i> tab page in the
<i>'Edit Entry'</i> dialog.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;How to enable
/ configure Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation?</h2>

<p>All you need to do is to tick the checkbox <i>&quot;Two-channel auto-type obfuscation&quot;</i>
of an entry ('Auto-Type' tab of the entry editing window); KeePass will do the rest.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_help.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical
Overview</h2>

<p>Instead of simply sending simulated keypresses to the target application (as normal
auto-type does), obfuscated auto-type does the following:</p>

<ul>
<!-- <li>Enable clipboard event blocker.</li> -->
<li>Backup the current clipboard contents.</li>
<li>Intelligently split the text into parts.</li>
<li>For each part: check if the clipboard can be used.

<ul>
<li><i>If yes:</i> Split it into two subparts (character-wise, like two
flat intertwining combs). Copy/paste the first part, merge the rest by sending keypresses.</li>
<li><i>If no:</i> Send it normally using simulated keypresses.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Restore previous clipboard contents.</li>
<!-- <li>Disable clipboard event blocker.</li> -->
</ul>

<p>These steps are described in detail below.</p>

<br />

Event Blocker</h2>

<p>Because we are heavily using the clipboard, it is useful to block all
current clipboard monitors. This means that no other applications will get
notified when KeePass changes the clipboard.</p>

<p>For this, an invisible window is created and added to the top of the
clipboard event handler chain. This window simply throws away all clipboard
change messages it receives, practically blocking all other applications
from receiving any events.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_kmultiple.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligently
Splitting the Text</h2>

<p>The text to be sent must first be split intelligently. Not all parts of the
string can be sent using the clipboard: special key codes and key modifiers must be passed
unchanged to the <code>SendInput</code> function. For an example, have a look at the following
string:</p>

<pre>mymail@myprovider.com{TAB}MyTopSecretPassword{TAB} {TAB}{ENTER}</pre>

<p>This is an example of a typical string sent by KeePass to another application. First
it types the user's email address, then a tab, then the password, a tab, toggles a checkbox,
another tab and finally presses the enter key. This sequence can be split into the following parts:</p>

<pre>mymail@myprovider.com
{TAB}
MyTopSecretPassword
{TAB}
' ' (space)
{TAB}
{ENTER}</pre>

<p>For each line, it is checked if the clipboard can be used. If the line contains a '{', '}', '(', ')',
'+', '^', '%' or whitespace (space), it can only be sent by the <code>SendInput</code> function
directly. '+' for example presses the Shift key, it should not be copy/pasted as '+' character.
Spaces can't be copy/pasted either, because they are usually used to toggle checkboxes.</p>

<p>In the example above, &quot;mymail@myprovider.com&quot; and &quot;MyTopSecretPassword&quot; can
be sent using the clipboard.</p>

<br />

<a name="splitsecret"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_kmultiple.png" class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Splitting
the Secrets</h2>

<p>Let's transfer &quot;mymail@myprovider.com&quot; to the target application using
TCATO.<!--
the clipboard now. KeePass could simply copy it to the clipboard and send a Ctrl+V keypress to the target
application, making it paste the clipboard contents. This would be perfectly secure against keyloggers
because they only see the Ctrl+V keypress but not the actual contents pasted. But there's
still a problem: a malicious application could monitor the clipboard based on time intervals
(i.e. not using the events - we've blocked those). Although the duration of the complete
copy/paste operation is only a few milliseconds, there's still a small chance that an attacker
could get the data in the clipboard. Therefore, the secrets are split. --></p>

<p>First, the secret string &quot;mymail@myprovider.com&quot; is randomly split character-wise
into two parts like two flat intertwining combs:</p>

<pre>&nbsp;y&nbsp;&nbsp;il&nbsp;m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;.c
m&nbsp;ma&nbsp;&nbsp;@&nbsp;ypr&nbsp;vi&nbsp;er&nbsp;&nbsp;om</pre>

<p>The first string &quot;yilmod.c&quot; is now copied to the clipboard. The string to be
sent by the <code>SendInput</code> function is now assembled as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Begin with pasting from the clipboard: <code>^v</code>.</li>
<li>Press the left arrow key <i>n</i> times, with <i>n = length of the clipboard string</i>.</li>
<li>Send the remaining characters and press the right arrow key to skip the ones that were
already pasted from the clipboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example above, the key sequence would be assembled to:</p>

<pre>^v{LEFT 8}m{RIGHT}ma{RIGHT}{RIGHT}@{RIGHT}ypr{RIGHT}vi{RIGHT}er{RIGHT}{RIGHT}om</pre>

<p>This will first paste the clipboard contents, go to its start and fill in the remaining characters,
building up the original string &quot;mymail@myprovider.com&quot;.</p>

<p>The time in which the first string part remains in the clipboard is minimal.
It is copied to the clipboard, pasted into the target application and immediately
cleared. This process usually takes only a few milliseconds at maximum.</p>

<p><b>More about secret string splitting:</b><br />
In the above example, the string &quot;mymail@myprovider.com&quot; was
split and sent. If the string would be split differently each time,
a malicious application could reassemble the string by
capturing multiple auto-types and combining them. In order to prevent this,
KeePass initializes the random number generator for splitting based on a
hash of the string. This means that each string is split differently,
but the partitions of a string are uniquely determined. So, by invoking
auto-type multiple times, an attacker cannot reassemble the original string,
because he always captures the same half part.</p>
