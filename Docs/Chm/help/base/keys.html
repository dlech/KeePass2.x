<hr />

<p>Your KeePass database file is encrypted using a master key.
This master key can consist of multiple components:
a master password, a key file and/or a key that is protected
using the current Windows user account.</p>

<p>For opening a database file, <em>all</em> components of the
master key are required.</p>

<p>If you forget/lose any of the master key components (or forget the
composition), all data stored in the database is lost.
There is no backdoor and no universal key that can open your database.</p>

Master Password</h2>

<p>If you use a master password, you only have to remember one password or
passphrase (which should be good!) to open your database.</p>

<p>KeePass features a protection against brute-force and dictionary attacks;
see the <a href="security.html#secdictprotect">security</a> help page
for details.</p>

<br />

<a name="keyfiles"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" alt="" />
Key File</h2>

<p>A key file is a file that contains a key (and possibly additional data,
e.g. a hash that allows to verify the integrity of the key).
The file extension typically is 'keyx' or 'key'.</p>

<p>A key file must not be modified, otherwise you cannot open your database
anymore. If you want to use a different key file, open the dialog for
changing the master key (via 'File' &rarr; 'Change Master Key')
and create/select the new key file.</p>

<p><b>Two-factor protection.</b>
A key file is something that you must <em>have</em> in order to be able
to open the database
(in contrast to a master password, which you must <em>know</em>).
If you use both a key file and a master password, you have a two-factor
protection: possession and knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Location.</b>
As mentioned above, the idea of a key file is that you <em>have</em>
something. If an attacker obtains both your database file and your
key file, then the key file provides no protection.
Therefore, the two files must be stored in different locations.
For example, you could store the key file on a separate USB stick.</p>

<p><b>Hiding the location.</b>
The key file <em>content</em> must be kept secret, not its location
(file path/name).
Trying to hide the key file (e.g. by storing it among
a thousand other files, in the hope that an attacker does not know which
file is the correct one) typically does not increase the security, because
it is easy to find out the correct file (e.g. by inspecting the last access
times of files, lists of recently used files of the operating system,
file system auditing logs, anti-virus software logs, etc.).
KeePass has an option for remembering the paths of key files,
which is turned on by default; turning it off typically just decreases
the usability without increasing the security.</p>

<p><b>Backup.</b>
You should create a backup of your key file (onto an independent data
storage device).
If your key file is an XML file (which is the default), you can also create
a backup on paper (KeePass 2.x provides a command for printing a key file
backup in the menu 'File' &rarr; 'Print').
In any case, the backup should be stored in a secure location, where only
you and possibly a few other people that you trust have access to.
More details about backing up a key file can be found in the
<a href="https://abp-keepass.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html" target="_blank">ABP FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><b>Formats.</b>
KeePass supports the following key file formats:</p>
<ul class="withspc">
<li><b>XML (recommended, default).</b>
There is an XML format for key files.
KeePass 2.x uses this format by default, i.e. when creating a key file
in the master key dialog, an XML key file is created.
The syntax and the semantics of the XML format allow to detect certain
corruptions (especially such caused by faulty hardware or transfer problems),
and a hash (in XML key files version 2.0 or higher) allows to
verify the integrity of the key.
This format is resistant to most encoding and new-line character changes
(which is useful for instance when the user is opening and saving the
key file or when transferring it from/to a server).
Such a key file can be printed (as a backup on paper),
and comments can be added in the file (with the usual XML syntax:
<code>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</code>).
It is the most flexible format; new features can be added easily
in the future.</li>

<li><b>32 bytes.</b>
If the key file contains exactly 32 bytes, these are used as
a 256-bit cryptographic key.
This format requires the least disk space.</li>

<li><b>Hexadecimal.</b>
If the key file contains exactly 64 hexadecimal characters
(0-9 and A-F, in UTF-8/ASCII encoding, one line, no spaces),
these are decoded to a 256-bit cryptographic key.</li>

<li><b>Hashed.</b>
If a key file does not match any of the formats above,
its content is hashed using a cryptographic hash function
in order to build a key (typically a 256-bit key with SHA-256).
This allows to use arbitrary files as key files.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Reuse.</b>
You can use one key file for multiple database files.
This can be convenient, but please keep in mind that when an
attacker obtains your key file, you have to change the master keys
of all database files protected with this key file.</p>






In order to reuse an existing key file, click on the 'Browse' button
in the master key creation dialog.

Windows User Account</h2>

<br />






KeePass can make the database dependent on the current Windows user
account. If you enable this option, you can only open the database when
you are logged in as the same Windows user when creating the database.<br />
<br />
<img src="../images/b16x16_warning.png" class="textimg" alt="Warning" />
Be very careful with using this option. If your Windows user account
gets deleted, you won't be able to open your KeePass database anymore.
Also, when using this option at home and your computer breaks (hard disk
damaged), it is not
enough to just create a new Windows account on the new installation with the
same name and password;
you need to copy the <i>complete</i> account (i.e. SID, ...). This is not
a simple task, so if you don't know how to do this, it is highly recommended
that you don't enable this option.
Detailed instructions how to recover a Windows user account can be found here:
'<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/wiki/Recover%20Windows%20User%20Account%20Credentials/"
target="_blank">Recover Windows User Account Credentials</a>'
(a short technical tutorial can be found in a Microsoft TechNet article:
<!-- https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee681624.aspx -->
<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/ee681624(v=ws.10) -->

target="_blank">How to recover a Vault corrupted by lost DPAPI keys</a>').<br />
<br />
You can change the password of the Windows user account freely;
this does not affect the KeePass database.
Note that <em>changing</em> the password (e.g. a user using the Control Panel
or pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>
and selecting 'Change Password') and
<em>resetting</em> it to a new one (e.g. an administrator using a
<code>NET USER <i>&lt;User&gt;</i> <i>&lt;NewPassword&gt;</i></code>
command) are two different things.
After <em>changing</em> your password, you can still open your KeePass database.
When <em>resetting</em> the password to a new one, access usually is not possible
anymore (because the user's DPAPI keys are lost), but there are exceptions
(for example when the user is in a domain, Windows can retrieve the user's DPAPI keys
from a domain controller, or a home user can use a previously created
Password Reset Disk).

If you decide to use this option, it is highly recommended not to rely
on it exclusively, but to additionally use one of the other two options (password
or key file).<br />

For Administrators: Specifying Minimum Properties of Master Keys</h2>

<p>Administrators can specify a minimum length
and/or the minimum estimated quality that master passwords must have in
order to be accepted. You can tell KeePass
to check these two minimum requirements by adding/editing
appropriate definitions in the
<a href="configuration.html">INI/XML configuration file</a>.</p>






The value of the
<code>Security/MasterPassword/MinimumLength</code> node specifies
the minimum master password length (in characters). For example, by setting
it to <code>10</code>, KeePass will only accept
master passwords that consist of at least 10 characters.<br />
<br />
The value of the
<code>Security/MasterPassword/MinimumQuality</code> node specifies
the minimum estimated quality (in bits) that master passwords must have.
For example, by setting it to <code>80</code>, only master passwords
with an estimated quality of at least 80 bits will be accepted.<br />
<br />
The <code>Security/MasterKeyExpiryRec</code> and <code>Security/MasterKeyExpiryForce</code>
nodes can be set to an XSD date or an XSD duration (see
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_dtypes_date.asp"
target="_blank">XSD Date and Time Data Types</a>).
If the master key has not been changed since the specified date or
if the time span between now and the last master key change exceeds
the specified duration, KeePass recommends/forces to change it.
These settings apply to all databases that are opened with this
KeePass instance; a master key expiry can also be configured for
each database individually (in 'File' &rarr; 'Database Settings' &rarr;
tab 'Advanced').<br />
<br />
By specifying <code>KeyCreationFlags</code> and/or <code>KeyPromptFlags</code>
(in the <code>UI</code> node), you can force states (enabled, disabled,
checked, unchecked) of key source controls in the master key creation and
prompt dialogs. These values can be bitwise combinations of one or more of
the following flags:<br />
<br />
<table class="tablebox75 flagstbl">
<tr><th>Flag (Hex)</th><th>Flag (Dec)</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x0</td><td>0</td>
<td>Don't force any states (default).</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x1</td><td>1</td>
<td>Enable password.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x2</td><td>2</td>
<td>Enable key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x4</td><td>4</td>
<td>Enable user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x8</td><td>8</td>
<td>Enable 'hide password' button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x100</td><td>256</td>
<td>Disable password.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x200</td><td>512</td>
<td>Disable key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x400</td><td>1024</td>
<td>Disable user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x800</td><td>2048</td>
<td>Disable 'hide password' button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x10000</td><td>65536</td>
<td>Check password.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x20000</td><td>131072</td>
<td>Check key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x40000</td><td>262144</td>
<td>Check user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x80000</td><td>524288</td>
<td>Check 'hide password' option/button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x1000000</td><td>16777216</td>
<td>Uncheck password.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x2000000</td><td>33554432</td>
<td>Uncheck key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x4000000</td><td>67108864</td>
<td>Uncheck user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x8000000</td><td>134217728</td>
<td>Uncheck 'hide password' option/button.</td></tr>
</table>

<br />
The values of <code>KeyCreationFlags</code> and <code>KeyPromptFlags</code>
must be specified in decimal notation.<br />
<br />
For example, if you want to enforce using the user account option, you could
check and disable the control (such that the user can't uncheck it anymore)
by specifying 263168 as value (0x40000 + 0x400 = 0x40400 = 263168).
