Auto-Type Information</h2>

<p>KeePass features an &quot;Auto-Type&quot; functionality. This feature allows you to define
a sequence of keypresses, which KeePass can automatically perform for you. The
simulated keypresses can be sent to any other currently open window of your choice (browser windows,
login dialogs, ...).</p>

<p>By default, the sent keystroke sequence is <code>{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code>,
i.e. it first types the user name of the selected entry, then presses the <code>Tab</code> key,
then types the password of the entry and finally presses the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>

<p>For <a href="tans.html">TAN entries</a>, the default sequence is <code>{PASSWORD}</code>,
i.e. it just types the TAN into the target window, without pressing <code>Enter</code>.</p>






Auto-Type can be configured individually for each entry using the
<i>Auto-Type</i> tab page on the entry dialog (select an entry -&gt; <i>Edit Entry</i>).
On this page you can specify a default sequence and customize specific
window/sequence associations.<br />
<br />
<a href="../v2/autotype_obfuscation.html">Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation</a> is supported (making
Auto-Type resistant against keyloggers).


<p>Additionally, you can create customized window/sequence associations, which override the
default sequence. You can specify different keystroke sequences for different windows for each entry.
For example, imagine a webpage, to which you want to login, that has multiple
pages where one can login. These pages could all look a bit different (on one
you could additionally need to check some checkbox -- like often seen in forums). Here
creating customized window/sequence associations solves the problems: you simply
specify different auto-type sequences for each windows (identified by their window
titles).</p>

<p><b>Invoking Auto-Type:</b><br />
There are three different methods to invoke auto-type:</p>

<ul>
<li>Invoke auto-type for an entry by using the
context menu command <i>Perform Auto-Type</i> while the entry is selected.</li>
<li>Select the entry and press <i>Ctrl+V</i> (that's
the menu shortcut for the context menu command above).</li>
<li>Using the system-wide auto-type hot key. KeePass will
search all entries in the currently opened database for matching sequences.</li>
</ul>

<p>All methods are explained in detail below.</p>

<br />

<a name="autoctx"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_ktouch.png"
class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Context
Menu: '<i>Perform Auto-Type</i>' Command</h2>

<p>This method is the one that requires the least amount of configuration and is
the simpler one, but it has the disadvantage that you need to select the entry
in KeePass which you want to auto-type.</p>

<p>The method is simple: right-click on an entry of your currently opened database
and click '<i>Perform Auto-Type</i>' (or alternatively press the <i>Ctrl+V</i>
shortcut for this command). The window that previously got the focus
(i.e. the one in which you worked before switching to KeePass) will be brought
to the foreground and KeePass auto-types into this window.</p>

<p>The sequence which is auto-typed depends on the window's title. If you didn't
specify any custom window/sequence associations, the default sequence is sent. If
you created associations, KeePass uses the sequence of the first matching
association. If none of the associations match, the default sequence is used.</p>

<br />

<a name="autoglobal"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_ktouch.png"
class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Global
Auto-Type Hot Key</h2>

<p>This is the more powerful method, but it also requires a little bit more
work/knowledge, before it can be used.</p>

<p><b>Simple Global Auto-Type Example:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Create an entry in KeePass titled <i>Notepad</i> with values for user name and password.</li>
<li>Start Notepad - under 'Programs' -&gt; 'Accessories'.</li>
<li>Press <i>LCtrl+Alt+A</i> within Notepad. The user name and
password will be typed into Notepad.</li>
</ol>

<p>The KeePass entry title <i>Notepad</i> is matched with the window title of
Notepad and the default Auto-Type sequence is typed.</p>

<p><b>How It Works - Details:</b></p>

<p>KeePass registers a system-wide hot key for auto-type. The advantage of
this hot key is that you don't need to switch to the KeePass window and
select the entry. You simply press the hot key while having the target window
open (i.e. the window which will receive the simulated keypresses).</p>

<p>By default, the global hot key is <i>LCtrl+Alt+A</i> (i.e. hold the left Ctrl and
Alt keys, press 'A' and release all keys). You can change this hot key
in the options dialog (main menu - 'Tools' - 'Options', tab



'Integration'):

here, click into the
textbox below &quot;Global Auto-Type Hot Key Combination&quot; and press the
hot key that you wish to use. If the hot key is usable, it will appear in the textbox.</p>

<p>When you press the hot key, KeePass will look at the title of the currently opened window and
search the currently opened database for usable entries. If KeePass finds multiple
entries that can be used, it displays a selection dialog. In order to decide if an
entry is usable for the current window title, at least one of the following conditions
must be fulfilled:</p>

<ul>
<li>The title of the entry is a substring of the currently active window title.</li>
<li>The entry has a window/sequence association, of which the window specifier matches
the currently active window title.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second condition has been mentioned already, but the first one
is new. By using entry titles as filters for window titles, the configuration amount
for auto-type is almost zero: you only need to make sure that the entry title
is contained in the window title of the window into which you want the entry to be
auto-typed. Of course, this is not always possible (for example, if a webpage has a
very generic title like <i>&quot;Welcome&quot;</i>), here you need to
use custom window/sequence associations.</p>






Custom window/sequence associations can be specified on the <i>'Auto-Type'</i> tab
page of each entry.<br />
<br />
The associations complement the KeePass entry title.
Any associations specified will be used in addition to the KeePass entry 
title to determine a match.

class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Auto-Type
Keystroke Sequences</h2>

<p>An auto-type keystroke sequence is a one-line string that can contain
placeholders and special key codes.</p>

<p>A complete list of all supported placeholders can be found on the page
<a href="placeholders.html">Placeholders</a>. The special key codes can
be found below.</p>

<p>Above you've seen already that the
default auto-type is <code>{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code>. Here,
<code>{USERNAME}</code> and <code>{PASSWORD}</code> are placeholders: when auto-type
is performed, these are replaced by the appropriate field values of the entry.
<code>{TAB}</code> and <code>{ENTER}</code> are special key codes: these are replaced
by the appropriate keypresses. Special key codes are the only way to specify special
keys like Arrow-Down, Shift, Escape, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, keystroke sequences can also contain simple characters to be sent.
For example, the following string is perfectly valid as keystroke sequence string:<br />
<code>{USERNAME}{TAB}Some text to be sent!{ENTER}</code>.</p>






Special key codes are case-insensitive.


<p><b>Special Keys:</b><br />
The following codes for special keys are supported:</p>

<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th width="50%">Special Key</th><th width="50%">Code</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Tab</td><td width="50%">{TAB}</td></tr>

<tr><td width="50%">Shift</td><td width="50%">+</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Ctrl</td><td width="50%">^</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">Alt</td><td width="50%">%</td></tr>
</table>

<br />






<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th width="50%">Special Key</th><th width="50%">Code</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">+</td><td width="50%">{+}</td></tr>

<tr><td width="50%">(, )</td><td width="50%">{(}, {)}</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">{, }</td><td width="50%">{{}, {}}</td></tr>
</table>


<p>Additionally, some special commands are supported:</p>

<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th width="50%">Command Syntax</th><th width="50%">Action</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">{DELAY <i>X</i>}</td><td width="50%">Delays <i>X</i> milliseconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">{VKEY <i>X</i>}</td><td width="50%">Sends the virtual key of value <i>X</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

<br />






<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th width="50%">Command Syntax</th><th width="50%">Action</th></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">{DELAY=<i>X</i>}</td><td width="50%">Sets the default delay to <i>X</i> milliseconds for all standard keypresses in this sequence.</td></tr>
</table>





Keys and special keys (not placeholders or commands) can be repeated by
appending a number within the code. For example, <code>{TAB 5}</code>
presses the Tab key 5 times.


<p>Finally, some examples:</p>

<p><code>{TITLE}{TAB}{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code><br />
Types the entry's title, a Tab, the user name, a Tab, the password of the
currently selected entry, and presses Enter.</p>

<p><code>{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code><br />
Presses the Tab key, enters the entry's password and presses Enter.</p>

<p><code>{USERNAME}{TAB}^v{ENTER}</code><br />
Types the user name, presses Tab, presses Ctrl-v (which pastes data from
the Windows clipboard in most applications), and presses Enter.</p>

<br />

<p><b>Toggling Checkboxes:</b><br />
Sometimes you find checkboxes on websites (<i>&quot;Stay logged in on this computer&quot;</i> for example).
You can toggle these checkboxes by sending a space character (<code>' '</code>)
when auto-typing. For example:<br />
<code>{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{TAB} {TAB}{ENTER}</code><br />
If there is a webform with a user name field, password field and a checkbox, this sequence would
enter the user name, the password and toggle the checkbox that follows the password
control.<br /><br />
</p>

<p><b>Pressing Non-Default Buttons:</b><br />
Pressing non-default buttons works the same as toggling checkboxes: send
a space character (<code>' '</code>).
Note that this should only be used for non-default buttons; for
default buttons, <code>{ENTER}</code> should be sent instead.<br /><br />
</p>

<p><b>Higher ANSI Characters:</b><br />
The auto-type function supports sending of higher ANSI characters in range 126-255. This
means that you can send special characters like &copy;, @, etc. without any problems;
you can write them directly into the keystroke sequence definition.</p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_window_list.png"
class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Target
Window Filters</h2>

<p>When creating a custom window/sequence association, you need to tell
KeePass how the matching window titles look like. Here, KeePass supports
simple wildcards:</p>

<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th width="25%">String with Wildcard</th><th width="75%">Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td width="25%">STRING</td><td width="75%">Matches all window titles that are named exactly &quot;STRING&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="25%">STRING*</td><td width="75%">Matches all window titles that start with &quot;STRING&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="25%">*STRING</td><td width="75%">Matches all window titles that end with &quot;STRING&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="25%">*STRING*</td><td width="75%">Matches all window titles that have &quot;STRING&quot; somewhere in the window title. This includes the string being directly at the start or at the end of the window title.</td></tr>
</table>

<br />






In KeePass &ge; 2.06, wildcards may also appear in the middle of patterns.
For example, <code>*Windows*Explorer*</code> would match
<code>Windows Explorer</code>.<br />
<br />
Additionally, matching using regular expressions is supported. In order to
tell KeePass that the pattern is a regular expression, enclose it in
<code>//</code>. For example, <code>//B.?g Window//</code> would
match <code>Big Window</code>, <code>Bug Window</code> and <code>Bg Window</code>.


<p>By using wildcards, you can make your auto-type associations browser-independent.
See the usage examples for more information.</p>

<br />

<a name="changedefaultseq"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/b16x16_ktouch.png"
class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Change Default Auto-Type Sequence</h2>

<p>The default auto-type sequence (i.e. the one which is used when you don't specify
a custom one) is <code>{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}</code>. KeePass allows you
to change this default sequence. Normally you won't need to change it (use
custom window/sequence definitions instead!), but it is quite useful when some
other application is interfering KeePass (for example a security software that
always asks you for permission before allowing KeePass to auto-type).</p>






By default, entries inherit the auto-type sequence of their containing group.
Groups also inherit the auto-type sequence of their parent groups. There is
only one top group (the first group contains all other groups). Consequently, if
you change the auto-type sequence of this very first group, all other groups
and their entries will use this sequence. Practically, this is a global override.
To change it, right-click on the first group, choose <i>'Edit Group'</i> and switch
to the <i>'Auto-Type'</i> tab.
<br />

<a name="autoexample"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle"><img src="../images/movepaper.gif"
class="singleimg" alt="Text" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage
Example</h2>

<p>Now let's have a look at a real-world example: logging into a website. In this example,
will we use the global auto-type hot key to fill out the login webpage.
First open the <a href="http://keepass.info/help/kb/kb090406_testform.html"
target="_blank">test page</a>, and afterwards create a new entry
in KeePass with title <i>Test Form</i> and a user name and password
of your choice.</p>

<p>Let's assume the global auto-type hot key is set to <i>LCtrl+Alt+A</i> (the default).
KeePass is running in the background, you have opened your database and the workspace is unlocked.</p>

<p>When you now navigate to the test page and are being prompted for your user name and password,
just click into the user name field and press <i>LCtrl+Alt+A</i>. KeePass enters the
user name and password for you!</p>

<p>Why did this work? The window title of your browser window was
<i>&quot;Test Form - KeePass - Internet Explorer&quot;</i> or
<i>&quot;Test Form - KeePass - Mozilla Firefox&quot;</i>, depending on the browser
you are using. Because we gave the entry in KeePass the title <i>Test Form</i>, the
entry title is contained in the window title, therefore KeePass uses this entry.</p>

<p>Here you see the huge advantages of auto-type: it not only doesn't require
any additional browser software
(the browser knows nothing of KeePass -- there are no helper browser plugins required),
it is also browser-independent: the one entry that you created within KeePass works
for Internet Explorer <i>and</i> Mozilla Firefox (and other browsers) without
requiring any modifications or definitions.</p>

<p>When you would use window/sequence associations
(instead of entry title matching), you can achieve the same
browser-independent effect using wildcards: you could for example have used
<code>Test Form - KeePass - *</code> as window filter. This filter matches both
the Internet Explorer and the Firefox window.</p>
