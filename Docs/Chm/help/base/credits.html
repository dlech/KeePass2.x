<p>Thanks to <b>Daniel Turini</b> for suggesting <i>&quot;KeePass&quot;</i>

<p>An especially <i>big</i> thanks to <b>Bill Rubin</b>. He not only contributed a lot of
source code to KeePass, he also had an enormous amount of feature and improvement suggestions,
helped people in the KeePass forums, and wrote a KeePass plugin for backing up
databases. He's also the reason why many of the sections in the KeePass Help
are very precise, helpful, clear and easy to understand.
In our countless hours long IM chats, we not only discussed much about the design
of KeePass, Bill also told me a lot about C++ and other stuff. Thanks!</p>

#######**** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****#######
The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries
in the first place. The LGPL has to be considered valid for this artwork
library too.
Nuvola icon theme for KDE 3.x is a special kind of software library, it is an
artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
GUI.
Source code, for this library means:
 - raster png image* .
The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly usefull.
With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
