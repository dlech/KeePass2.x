<!-- Cf. home page of the website -->
<p>Today, you have to remember many passwords. You need a password for a lot of
websites, your e-mail account, your webserver, network logins, etc.
The list is endless.
Also, you should use a different password for each account, because
if you would use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password,
you would have a problem: the thief would have access to <em>all</em> of your
accounts.</p>

<p>KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage
your passwords in a secure way. You can store all your passwords in one
database, which is locked with a
<a href="keys.html">master key</a>. So you only have to remember one
single master key to unlock the whole database. Database files are
<a href="security.html#secencrypt">encrypted</a>
using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known
(AES-256, ChaCha20 and Twofish).</p>

<p>The database consists of only one file, so it can be transferred
easily from one computer to another.
Data can also be <a href="importexport.html">imported/exported</a>
from/to various other formats
(import from more than 40 different formats of other password managers,

<a href="importexport.html#genericcsv">generic CSV importer</a>,

...). Of course, printing entries is supported, too.</p>

<p>KeePass supports groups, which allow you to organize your entries
conveniently. For quickly locating specific entries, there are search
functions.</p>

<p>There are various methods for transferring entry data (like user names
and passwords) from KeePass to other applications
(<a href="usingpws.html#mainlist">clipboard</a>,
<a href="usingpws.html#dragdrop">drag&amp;drop</a>, etc.). The powerful
<a href="autotype.html">auto-type</a> feature can simulate keypresses.</p>

<p>KeePass has a strong <a href="pwgenerator.html">password generator</a>
(you can define allowed characters, length, generation rules, ...).</p>

<p>The program features a <a href="https://keepass.info/plugins.html"
target="_blank">plugin</a> architecture. Plugins can add features
in many areas (integration, transfer, backup, network, even more
import/export formats, and much more).</p>

<p>As KeePass is open source,
you can have a look at its full source code and check whether the security
features are implemented correctly.</p>
