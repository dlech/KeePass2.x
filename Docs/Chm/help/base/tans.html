<p>KeePass supports TANs, i.e. passwords that can be used only
once.
These special passwords are used by some banks: you need to confirm
transactions using such TANs. This provides additional security, as
a spy cannot perform transactions, even if he knows the password of
your banking account.</p>

Using the <i>TAN Wizard</i> to add TANs</h2>

<p>You can use the KeePass <b>TAN Wizard</b> to add several TANs at once to your
database. Just open the TAN wizard dialog (menu <i>Tools</i> - <i>TAN Wizard</i>) and enter
all your TANs. The formatting doesn't really
matter, KeePass just uses all alphanumerical strings, i.e. characters like line breaks,
tabs, spaces, dots, etc. are interpreted as separators.</p>

<p>The wizard will then generate several TAN entries from the data you entered into the dialog. Each
TAN is a standard KeePass entry. The title of a TAN entry always is set to &quot;<code>&lt;TAN&gt;</code>&quot;.
This tells KeePass that the entry is a TAN entry. You cannot change the title, user
name and URL of a TAN. But you can freely add notes to a TAN entry, if you wish.</p>

Using TANs</h2>

<p>When you use the TAN (e.g. execute the &quot;Copy Password&quot; command on
it), its expiration date will be set
to the current time, which expires the entry. It will get a red
<span style="color: #FF0000;"><b>X</b></span> as icon.
If you later want to know when you used a specific TAN,
you can just have a look at its expiration date.</p>

<p>When copying a TAN to the clipboard, the database is marked as modified. You must save
the file in order to remember the usage of a TAN.</p>

<p>If you accidently used a TAN without needing it, you can reset it (i.e. remove the red
<span style="color: #FF0000;"><b>X</b></span> and show it as valid TAN again). To do this, open the
TAN entry (right-click it and choose <i>'Edit/View Entry...'</i>). Here, uncheck the
<i>'Expires'</i> checkbox. Click [OK] to close the dialog.</p>
