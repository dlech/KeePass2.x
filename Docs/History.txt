  URL override, each of these placeholders is replaced by the
  specified part of the string that is being overridden)
- Added {NEWPASSWORD:/Profile/} placeholder, which generates a
  new password for the current entry using the specified
  password generator profile
- Pattern-based password generator: the '^' character now
  removes the next character from the current custom character

  systems
- Various code optimizations
- Minor other improvements

  invalid sequences; differential delays, making the auto-type
  process less susceptible to externally caused delays;
  automatic cancelling is now more precise up to at most one
  keypress and also works on Unix-like systems; improved
  message processing during auto-type)
- When trying to open an entry attachment that the built-in
  editor/viewer cannot handle, KeePass now extracts the

  afterwards the user can choose between importing/discarding
  changes and KeePass deletes the temporary file securely

  initially tries to guess the fields and their order based on
  the first row)
- Native master key transformations are now computed in two
  threads on 64-bit systems, too; on dual/multi core processors

  customizations like inserting delays, and provide alternative
  key sending methods)
- Plugin developers: added UIStateUpdated main window event

- Simple text boxes now convert rich text immediately
- Improved entry change detection (avoid unnecessary backups
  when closing the entry dialog with [OK] but without any

2009-07-05: 2.08
- Key transformation library: KeePass can now use Windows'
  CNG/BCrypt API for key transformations (about 50% faster than
  the KeePass built-in key transformation code; by increasing
  the amount of rounds by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time
  as in 2.07, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is raised by a factor of 1.5; only Windows
  Vista and higher)
- Added support for sending keystrokes (auto-type) to windows
  that are using different keyboard layouts

  {DT_UTC_DAY}, {DT_UTC_HOUR}, {DT_UTC_MINUTE}, {DT_UTC_SECOND}
- The password character picking dialog now supports pre-
  defining the number of characters to pick; append :k in the
  placeholder to specify a length of k (for example,

  having picked k characters, the dialog closes automatically,
  i.e. saves you to click [OK]

  anymore

2009-03-14: 2.07 Beta
- Added powerful trigger system (when events occur, check some
  conditions and execute a list of actions; see options dialog
  in 'Advanced'; more events / conditions / actions can be
  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided
  by plugins)
- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
  results in almost triple the performance as before (by
  tripling the amount of rounds you'll get the same waiting
  time as in 2.06, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is tripled)
- Added recycle bin (enabled by default, it can be disabled in
  the database settings dialog)
- Added Salsa20 stream cipher for CryptoRandomStream (this
