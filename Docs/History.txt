2009-07-05: 2.08
- Key transformation library: KeePass can now use Windows'
  CNG/BCrypt API for key transformations (about 50% faster than
  the KeePass built-in key transformation code; by increasing
  the amount of rounds by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time
  as in 2.07, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is raised by a factor of 1.5; only Windows
  Vista and higher)
- Added support for sending keystrokes (auto-type) to windows
  that are using different keyboard layouts
- Added option to remember key file paths (enabled by default)
- Added internal editor for text files (text only and RTF
  formatted text; editor can edit entry attachments)
- Internal data viewer: added support for showing rich text
  (text with formatting)
- Added inheritable group settings for disabling auto-type and
  searching for all entries in this group (see tab 'Behavior');
  for new recycle bins, both properties are set to disabled
- Added new placeholders: {DB_PATH}, {DB_DIR}, {DB_NAME},
  {DB_BASENAME}, {DB_EXT}, {ENV_DIRSEP}, {DT_SIMPLE},
  {DT_YEAR}, {DT_MONTH}, {DT_DAY}, {DT_HOUR}, {DT_MINUTE},
  {DT_SECOND}, {DT_UTC_SIMPLE}, {DT_UTC_YEAR}, {DT_UTC_MONTH},
  {DT_UTC_DAY}, {DT_UTC_HOUR}, {DT_UTC_MINUTE}, {DT_UTC_SECOND}
- The password character picking dialog now supports pre-
  defining the number of characters to pick; append :k in the
  placeholder to specify a length of k (for example,
  {PICKPASSWORDCHARS3:5} would be a placeholder with ID 3 and
  would pick 5 characters from the password); advantage: when
  having picked k characters, the dialog closes automatically,
  i.e. saves you to click [OK]

  anymore
- The password character picking dialog now first dereferences
  passwords (i.e. placeholders can be used here, too)

  of array bounds exception text, ...)

  in 'Advanced'; more events / conditions / actions can be
  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided
  by plugins)
- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
  results in almost triple the performance as before (by
  tripling the amount of rounds you'll get the same waiting
  time as in 2.06, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is tripled)
- Added recycle bin (enabled by default, it can be disabled in
  the database settings dialog)
- Added Salsa20 stream cipher for CryptoRandomStream (this

  Salsa20 now; port developers: KeePass uses Salsa20 for the
  inner random stream in KDBX files)

  languages will be published on the KeePass translations page
  when translators finish them)
- When saving the database, KeePass now first checks whether

  section in the online KeePass help center)

  of a group (see 'View' -> 'Show Entries of Sub-Groups')
