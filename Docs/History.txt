  having attachments
- KDBX file format: attachments are now compressed (if the
  compression option is enabled) before being Base64-encoded,

2009-09-12: 2.09

  customizations like inserting delays, and provide alternative
  key sending methods)
- Plugin developers: added UIStateUpdated main window event

- Simple text boxes now convert rich text immediately

2009-07-05: 2.08
- Key transformation library: KeePass can now use Windows'
  CNG/BCrypt API for key transformations (about 50% faster than
  the KeePass built-in key transformation code; by increasing
  the amount of rounds by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time
  as in 2.07, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is raised by a factor of 1.5; only Windows
  Vista and higher)
- Added support for sending keystrokes (auto-type) to windows
  that are using different keyboard layouts

  {DT_UTC_DAY}, {DT_UTC_HOUR}, {DT_UTC_MINUTE}, {DT_UTC_SECOND}
- The password character picking dialog now supports pre-
  defining the number of characters to pick; append :k in the
  placeholder to specify a length of k (for example,

  having picked k characters, the dialog closes automatically,
  i.e. saves you to click [OK]

  anymore

  in 'Advanced'; more events / conditions / actions can be
  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided
  by plugins)
- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
  results in almost triple the performance as before (by
  tripling the amount of rounds you'll get the same waiting
  time as in 2.06, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is tripled)

  the database settings dialog)
- Added Salsa20 stream cipher for CryptoRandomStream (this

  languages will be published on the KeePass translations page
  when translators finish them)
- When saving the database, KeePass now first checks whether
  the file on disk/server has been modified since it was loaded

  changed file instead of overwriting it (i.e. multiple users
  can now use a shared database on a network drive)
