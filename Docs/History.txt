2009-09-12: 2.09

  customizations like inserting delays, and provide alternative
  key sending methods)
- Plugin developers: added UIStateUpdated main window event

- Simple text boxes now convert rich text immediately

2009-07-05: 2.08
- Key transformation library: KeePass can now use Windows'
  CNG/BCrypt API for key transformations (about 50% faster than
  the KeePass built-in key transformation code; by increasing
  the amount of rounds by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time
  as in 2.07, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is raised by a factor of 1.5; only Windows
  Vista and higher)
- Added support for sending keystrokes (auto-type) to windows
  that are using different keyboard layouts

- The password character picking dialog now supports pre-
  defining the number of characters to pick; append :k in the
  placeholder to specify a length of k (for example,

  having picked k characters, the dialog closes automatically,
  i.e. saves you to click [OK]

  anymore

2009-03-14: 2.07 Beta

  in 'Advanced'; more events / conditions / actions can be
  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided
  by plugins)
- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
